## About Me
I am interested in learning as much as i can about front end web design. I love creepy horror things, obssessed with Cryptids especially mothman. I have really bad ADHD but I am learning to cope with it and live with it. I am currently in a weightloss program and love going to the gym. 
*Optional: A sentence or two about your design interests. This could seed your eventual portfolio bio.*

<!-- 
Example: "I'm drawn to motion design and systems thinking. 
Currently exploring how interaction design can feel more human."
