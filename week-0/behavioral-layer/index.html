    <p>Little Daisy Days</p>

    <ul> <!-- changed to list in the tutorial -->
      <li>Not one flower. Daisies are made of many tiny flowers.</li>
      <li>Very tough. They grow in lots of places.</li>
      <li>Petals close at night and open in the morning.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Daisies are simple, bright flowers with white petals and a yellow center. They are known for looking cheerful without trying too hard. People usually connect daisies with innocence, happiness, and fresh starts, which is probably why they show up in cards, gardens, and kid drawings everywhere. They grow easily in lots of places and do not need much care, unlike some high-maintenance plants that act like divas.</p>

<p>Daisies also have a funny structure. What looks like one flower is actually many tiny flowers packed together. Nature loves a good trick. Because they are tough and adaptable, daisies often symbolize strength in a quiet way. Not flashy, just steady. They are basically the friendly, low-drama flower of the plant world.</p>
