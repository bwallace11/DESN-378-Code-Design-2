  <details>
    <summary>What I Learned</summary>
    <p>
      The only new thing for me is GitHub. I’m still learning it and not fully
      sure how everything works yet.
    </p>
  

  
    <summary>What Was Hard?</summary>
    <p>
      I didn’t get very frustrated except for figuring out how to link GitHub.
      I still don’t fully understand that part.
    </p>



    <summary>How I Used AI?</summary>
    <p>
      I didn’t use AI for this week since it was material I already knew.
      I did use W3Schools a little.
    </p>


    <summary>What’s Still Unclear?</summary>
    <p>
      I need to get more comfortable with GitHub and understand linking better.
    </p>

  <p class="weeklyLL">Week 1: Systems That Respond</p>

  <details>
    <summary>What I Learned</summary>
    <p>
      I already knew some basic JavaScript, so parts of this made sense.
      Some concepts don’t fully stick until I actually see them while coding.
      I also keep forgetting that <code>var</code> isn’t used anymore and that
      <code>let</code> is standard.
    </p>



    <summary>What Was Hard</summary>
    <p>
      I sometimes get lost in my own thoughts and forget what things do until I
      actively start using them.
    </p>


    <summary>How I Used AI</summary>
    <p>
      I used AI when I wanted help implementing things like sound effects or
      falling hearts.
    </p>



    <summary>What’s Still Unclear</summary>
    <p>
      I still need more practice with GitHub and remembering terminology.
    </p>
