## About This Repository

This is my workspace for **DESN 378 Code + Design 2** also known as **Web Design 2** (or in the future, **Web Design + Code 2**) at Eastern Washington University. **The question this course asks:** How should things behave? In DESN 368, I learned how to make things look right. Here, I'm learning how to make things behave right — treating code as a design material with properties, behaviors, and constraints, just like paint, paper, or clay. Throughout the quarter, I'll work with four digital materials: CSS systems, SVG, animation libraries, and generative code — learning how each responds to manipulation and what each makes possible. Unlike courses focused on user research or backend engineering, this one asks: How does it feel? By the end, this repo will become my portfolio.

### Week 1: Systems That Respond
## Week 1
​
### What I Learned
I know some basic JavaScript so I understood some of that, I still struggle with some concepts in my head but that is just my ADHD, when I see it clicks. Its Just remembering
I also forget Var isnt a thing anymore and its LET.
​
​
### What Was Hard
The only thing that fustrates me is that I get lost in my own head sometimes and forget what things mean or do untill im actually doing it.
​
​
### How I Used AI
I use ai when I really want something like how to impliment sound, or Falling hearts.
​
​
### What's Still Unclear
I still just need more practice with Github and just remembering terms.
