## About This Repository

This is my workspace for **DESN 378 Code + Design 2** also known as **Web Design 2** (or in the future, **Web Design + Code 2**) at Eastern Washington University. **The question this course asks:** How should things behave? In DESN 368, I learned how to make things look right. Here, I'm learning how to make things behave right — treating code as a design material with properties, behaviors, and constraints, just like paint, paper, or clay. Throughout the quarter, I'll work with four digital materials: CSS systems, SVG, animation libraries, and generative code — learning how each responds to manipulation and what each makes possible. Unlike courses focused on user research or backend engineering, this one asks: How does it feel? By the end, this repo will become my portfolio.

## Learning Log

## Week 0
​
### What I Learned
<!-- What concepts clicked for you? What was new? -->
This week was mostly review for me. A lot of the JavaScript basics like variables and strings were things I had already seen before, so nothing felt completely new. What did click more was how everything connects together. Instead of just knowing what a variable is, I started thinking more about why I’m using it and how it controls what happens on the page.

GitHub was really the only new thing. I understand the idea of repositories and pushing code, but I don’t feel fully confident with it yet.
​
​
### What Was Hard
<!-- What frustrated you? What didn't make sense? -->
The only part that really slowed me down was linking GitHub correctly. It wasn’t frustrating in a huge way, but it’s still not something I can do automatically without double checking.

Other than that, the concepts themselves made sense.
​
### How I Used AI
<!-- Did you use Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.? How did it help or not help? -->
I didn’t use AI this week. Since this was mostly review, I relied on what I already knew. I did use W3Schools a little to double check small things.
​
### What's Still Unclear
<!-- What questions do you still have? What needs more practice? -->
I just need more practice using GitHub and understanding how linking works. That’s the part I’m still shaky on.

# Learning Log
​
## Week 1
​
### What I Learned
<!-- What concepts clicked for you? What was new? -->
​Some of this week built on things I already knew, but it helped me connect them better. I’m starting to understand how JavaScript actually makes things respond instead of just existing.

I also keep having to remind myself that var isn’t really used anymore and that let and const are standard now.
​
### What Was Hard
<!-- What frustrated you? What didn't make sense? -->
​Sometimes I overthink things and forget what something does until I see it working in the browser. When I’m just reading code, it doesn’t always fully stick. Once I test it though, it makes more sense.
​
### How I Used AI
<!-- Did you use Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.? How did it help or not help? -->
​I used AI mostly when I wanted to implement something extra, like sound effects or falling hearts. It helped me figure out structure and logic, especially when I didn’t know where to start.
​
### What's Still Unclear
<!-- What questions do you still have? What needs more practice? -->
​Mostly GitHub terminology and flow. I need repetition with it before it feels natural.

## Week 2
​
### What I Learned
<!-- What concepts clicked for you? What was new? -->
​This week I learned how to use variables in Figma in a more serious way. Not just colors thrown onto a page, but actual systems. It made me think more about consistency and how design decisions can scale, especially if multiple people are working on something.
​
### What Was Hard
<!-- What frustrated you? What didn't make sense? -->
​Nothing felt overwhelming. I’m getting more used to GitHub, and when I get stuck I’ve been researching on my own before asking 
for help.
​
### How I Used AI
<!-- Did you use Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.? How did it help or not help? -->
​I used AI to help generate opposite color values for my light mode. It made the process faster when I needed color adjustments that still felt balanced.
​
### What's Still Unclear
<!-- What questions do you still have? What needs more practice? -->
​Nothing major right now. I feel pretty steady this week.

## Week 3
​
### What I Learned
<!-- Design tokens, state vs appearance, system preference, persistence -->
​I learned how to move my Figma variables into CSS and actually use them properly. Making light and dark mode work felt really cool, especially adding a save state so the theme stays when you come back. That made it feel more real and less like a class project.
​
### What Was Hard
<!-- What broke, confused you, or took time to understand -->
​It wasn’t hard, just a little confusing at first understanding what the number values meant in color variables and how everything connects.
​
### How I Used AI
<!-- Copilot, ChatGPT, etc. What you asked and why -->
​I used AI to help implement the save state with localStorage and to add an icon to the toggle button.
​
### What's Still Unclear
<!-- Questions that remain -->
​Nothing at the moment.
​

### Work Completed (Week 3)

**Design Tokens**
- [✔] variables.css exists
- [✔] Color tokens defined
- [✔] Typography tokens defined
- [✔] Spacing tokens defined

## Week 4
​
### What I Learned
<!-- SVG's, dropdown, svg paths -->
​This week I learned that SVGs are basically just code, which kind of changed how I see them. Before, I thought of them more like design assets. Now I see that I can control every point and path if I understand what I’m doing.

I also learned how to make SVGs interactive, which made them feel way more powerful.
​
### What Was Hard
<!-- What broke, confused you, or took time to understand -->
​Understanding SVG paths was confusing at first. The letters and numbers felt random until I started editing small values and seeing what changed. Once I experimented more, it started to click.

I don’t think I’ll be an SVG expert any time soon, but I’m not scared of them anymore.
​
### How I Used AI
<!-- Copilot, ChatGPT, etc. What you asked and why -->
​I used AI to break down sections of SVG code and explain what each part did. That helped me connect the visual result to the 
actual code.
​
### What's Still Unclear
<!-- Questions that remain -->
​I still feel like complex SVG paths would be hard to write from scratch without a reference. I understand them more now, but I’ll need more practice to feel confident.
​

## Week 5

### What I Learned
<!-- SVG's, dropdown, svg paths -->
I learned a lot about how SVGs actually work instead of just copying them from somewhere and hoping for the best. I understand paths better now and how small changes in the path data can completely change the shape. I also got more comfortable working with dropdowns and connecting them to functionality instead of just styling them.

I feel like I finally understand that SVGs are not just “images” but code. That shift kind of changed how I look at them. It made me realize I have way more control than I thought.
​
​
### What Was Hard
<!-- What broke, confused you, or took time to understand -->
​Honestly, figuring out why things were breaking was the hardest part. Sometimes one tiny mistake in the SVG path would mess everything up and I had no idea why. Debugging took way longer than I expected.
​
### How I Used AI
<!-- Copilot, ChatGPT, etc. What you asked and why -->
​I asked it to explain concepts in simpler terms, especially for SVG paths. Sometimes I just needed it broken down in a way that made more sense to me. I tried to understand what it changed and why.
​
### What's Still Unclear
<!-- Questions that remain -->
I still feel a little unsure about writing complex SVG paths from scratch without looking at a reference. I understand them better, but I don’t feel fully confident yet.

I also want to get more comfortable debugging on my own before immediately asking for help. I can do it, but it still takes me a while to fully trust myself.
